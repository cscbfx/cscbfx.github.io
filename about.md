The Bioinformatics Lunchtime Mingle is a monthly event for sharing knowledge of 
all things related to bioinformatics and computational biology.  Anyone who uses 
bioinformatics or computational biology in their work, or who wants to learn more 
about them, is welcome! It's held on Tuesday lunchtimes in seminar room A. Meetings 
usually consist of a short presentation followed by general discussion of the topic 
and/or problems brought by attendees.

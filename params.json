In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Organisers\r\n\r\nThe events are organised by Toni Beltran, Bertie Gyenes, and Liz Ing-Simmons (@liz-is).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
